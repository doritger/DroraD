She codes prior course: web

Project Description:
A user interface for a personal website (for my mother, a sculptures).
The interface will allow the user to manage the site’s contents, i.e. upload and update images & text information for a Works page, Exhibitions page, About page and a News page.
The interface should be very intuitive and easy to use.
Graphically, it will display the different pages as in separate pages, and boxes to upload the above mentioned contents.   
(If the time tables will allow it, it will also include a search option to search artworks by name and date, and an active Contact page).

Why did you choose the idea:
During the she codes; web course I build a website for my mother, and would like her to be able to manage it independently. 
In addition, I very much enjoyed the web course and would like to expand my technological front-end toolbox and learn React, as well as experience in back-end utilities. 

Programming languages and technologies:
Front-end: react
Back-end: serverless utilities such as Firebase and Rest

Prior knowledge:
C language on Linux environment as part of a Infinity Labs R&D “bootcamp” that focused on algorithms and data-structures.  

Additional information:
The website is already mostly built in HTML5, CCS3, JavaScript
